# Number Guessing Game in C

## Description
This repository hosts a simple yet engaging number guessing game implemented in the C programming language. The game randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, which the user must guess within the minimum number of attempts. Through a series of try-and-error guesses, players receive hints indicating whether their guessed number is higher or lower than the actual target number. The game continues until the user successfully guesses the correct number.
